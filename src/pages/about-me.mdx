# About me

Hey, my name is **Luca**! Iâ€™m a web developer whose main focus is **front-end** development. I always try my best to improve **users** as well as **developers'** **experience** in every project I lay hands on.

In whichever site I'm building I treat **accessibility and performance as cornerstones** on the user end and an **explicit and well-organized code base** on the developer end.

My programming language of choice is **JavaScript**, and since I started learning programming I fell in love with its practicality and how it enables one to **create great experiences**.

While contributing to projects, I enjoy doing so in a _holistic way_, as in my opinion, feeling **ownership** of the product is **key** to long-term **success**.

Besides coding, reading blogs, and listening to podcasts related to software, on weekends you can find me **biking** on the [Rambla](/rambla.jpg) or playing **basketball** on one of the public courts laying around my neighborhood. I also have a soft spot for rock **music** and sci-fi **movies**. These activities are the core of my **entertainment**, but what I _love_ the most is taking care of [these](/cats.gif) two furry rascals.
